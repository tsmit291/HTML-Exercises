    <h2>Cities I would like to visit</h2>
    <p>I have been trying to learn French for a few months and would love to experience real french cuisine. Vancouver is one of the cleanest cities and I hear they have really neat architecture. San Francisco is a tech-hub and I would love to see the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
